# SimonSays - A Discord bot
Written in my spare time so that I can always hear my mate's voice whilst he is deployed in the Royal Navy

About half-way through writing the bot, I became aware it was an unmaintanable mess of spaghetti code. In hindsight, this should have been completely rewritten (with comments! <sup>what on earth was I thinking?!</sup>). Regardless, I had great fun writing it, and it ran flawlessly for over a year on a free f1-micro Google Cloud instance.

The app no longer functions since Discord changed the bot system (and since my friend is back from his submarine trip, it's not required!)

## Usage
Type `simon` in any chat, and the bot will:
- Join your current voice channel
- Play some of Simon's verbalied thoughts at random
- Leave
